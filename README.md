# Import-Hub

## Idea
Import Hub is a project made by me for Content Develepment Team during internship at idealo.de in Berlin. It Was later connected with Python script and Flask to work as a inner tool for my colleagues. 

It was used to manage data (products) on our webside in a more efficient way. My project is fully responsive.
